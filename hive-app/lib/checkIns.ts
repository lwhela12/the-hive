/**
 * When Home nudges a member about the halfway check-in, and what it says.
 *
 * OG's halfway feeds the newsletter, which goes out on the 1st, so OG's
 * window rides the CALENDAR — the last five days of the month — and the copy
 * talks about the newsletter. That was the only shape until 2026-08-12.
 *
 * **Tech doesn't meet on a rhythm the calendar month describes.** When Tech
 * sat on the first Thursday, the end of the month was about the worst
 * possible moment to call something "halfway" — the nudge landed three or
 * four days before the meeting, not midway between two. Tech has since moved
 * to the second Thursday, which shifts the problem rather than removing it.
 * So Tech's window is measured from its own next meeting, whatever date that
 * turns out to be, and it keeps working if the day moves again. Tech's
 * halfway also has no newsletter step at all (pulse and shout-outs only), so
 * OG's copy promised Tech members something that isn't in their flow.
 *
 * A third HIVE is a third entry here, the same way the deck and the check-in
 * flows are third lists rather than third slug checks.
